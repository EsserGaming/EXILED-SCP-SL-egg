## Contributing

Below are instructions to make changes to the egg:

When you send a pull request only update `script.sh` if you are only making changes to the script!
Changes are unreadable if you update the script in`SCP-SL-Exiled-Egg.json` because pterodactyl compiles it down to one line.

Otherwise if you need to make changes to variables, change the variables in `SCP-SL-Exiled-Egg.json` and change the script in `script.sh`
